# GeoTrack
Mobile geoposition tracking application

Before commit or push, please, run the script "husky_install" once. This command will enable git hooks "pre-commit" and "pre-push" for the repository. These hooks will make it possible to check commits.

If the git hooks still don't work, enter the following command in the IDE terminal. This command will grant access rights to Husky files. For Linux/MacOS/WSL: chmod ug+x .husky/*
